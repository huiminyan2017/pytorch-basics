    "#### Skip-Gram with Global Corpus Statistics (SG-GCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview\n",
    "- Defines $q_{ij} = P(w_j | w_i)$ as the conditional probability of context word $w_j$ given center word $w_i$.  \n",
    "- Computed as:  \n",
    "  $$ q_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(u_j \\cdot v_i)}{\\sum_k \\exp(u_k \\cdot v_i)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Idea\n",
    "- The model uses **global co-occurrence counts** instead of local context windows.  \n",
    "- For each center word $w_i$, its context words $w_j$ have multiplicities $x_{ij}$, representing the number of times $w_j$ appears in the context of $w_i$.  \n",
    "- The skip-gram objective becomes: $ J = - \\sum_i \\sum_j x_{ij} \\log q_{ij} $\n",
    "- This is equivalent to:\n",
    "  $J = - \\sum_i x_i \\sum_j p_{ij} \\log q_{ij}$, where $p_{ij}$ is the conditional probability $x_{ij}/x_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "- $\\sum_j p_{ij} \\log q_{ij}$ is the **cross-entropy** between the empirical distribution (from corpus statistics) and the model distribution. It is also weighted by $x_i$.\n",
    "- Minimizing this loss aligns the predicted distribution $q_{ij}$ with corpus co-occurrence data $p_{ij}$.  \n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "  - Computing softmax over all words is very expensive\n",
    "  - Rare words may dominate the loss / a large number of rare events from a large corpus are often modeled by the cross-entropy loss to be assigned with too much weight ？？？\n",

    "#### The GloVe Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "The **GloVe (Global Vectors)** model modifies the skip-gram approach by using a **squared loss** and directly modeling the **ratios of co-occurrence probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Main Changes\n",
    "1. Replace probabilities with raw co-occurrence counts:  \n",
    "   $$ f_{ij} = x_{ij}, \\quad \\hat{f}_{ij} = \\exp(u_j \\cdot v_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a **squared loss function** instead of cross-entropy:  \n",
    "   $$ J = (u_j \\cdot v_i + b_i + c_j - \\log x_{ij})^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Introduce a **weighting function** to control the influence of frequent/rare pairs:  \n",
    "   $$ h(x_{ij}) =\n",
    "   \\begin{cases}\n",
    "   (x_{ij}/a)^\\alpha, & \\text{if } x_{ij} < a \\\\\n",
    "   1, & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "   \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Typical values: $a = 100$, $\\alpha = 0.75$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Final GloVe Loss Function\n",
    "$$ J = \\sum_{i,j} h(x_{ij}) (u_j \\cdot v_i + b_i + c_j - \\log x_{ij})^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Intuition\n",
    "- GloVe learns embeddings where vector differences capture **meaningful relationships** between words.  \n",
    "- The weighting function keeps the model numerically stable by preventing overemphasis on very frequent or very rare co-occurrences.  \n",
    "- Training is symmetric — swapping $(w_i, w_j)$ gives comparable embeddings."

    "#### Interpreting GloVe from the Ratio of Co-occurrence Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Core Concept\n",
    "Let $p_{ij} = P(w_j | w_i)$ be the conditional probability of word $w_j$ occurring in the context of $w_i$.  \n",
    "The **ratio** $p_{ij} / p_{ik}$ reflects how words relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "| Context Word | solid | gas | water | fashion |\n",
    "|---------------|-------|-----|--------|----------|\n",
    "| $p1 = P(w_j \\mid ice)$ | 0.00019 | 0.000066 | 0.003 | 0.000017 |\n",
    "| $p2 = P(w_j \\mid steam)$ | 0.000022 | 0.00078 | 0.0022 | 0.000018 |\n",
    "| Ratio ($p_1/p_2$) | 8.9 | 0.085 | 1.36 | 0.96 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "- Words like **solid** relate more to *ice* → high ratio (8.9).  \n",
    "- Words like **gas** relate more to *steam* → low ratio (0.085).  \n",
    "- Words like **water** relate to both → ratio ≈ 1.  \n",
    "- Unrelated words like **fashion** → ratio near 1 but meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mathematical View\n",
    "We want a function $f$ that can model this ratio: $f(w_i, w_j, w_k) \\approx \\frac{P_{ij}}{P_{ik}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural exponential form that depends on vector differences: $f(w_i, w_j, w_k) = \\frac{\\exp(u_i^\\top v_j)}{\\exp(u_i^\\top v_k)} = \\exp\\!\\big((v_j - v_k)^\\top u_i\\big)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equating both sides gives: $\\exp\\!\\big((v_j - v_k)^\\top u_i\\big) \\approx \\frac{P_{ij}}{P_{ik}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the log on both sides yields: $(v_j - v_k)^\\top u_i = \\log P_{ij} - \\log P_{ik}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that each dot product $u_i^\\top v_j$ should correspond (up to bias) to the **log of the co-occurrence probability**: $u_i^\\top v_j + b_i + c_j \\approx \\log P_{ij}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij}}{x_i}$, the normalization term $\\log x_i$ can be absorbed into the bias $b_i$, giving: $u_i^\\top v_j + b_i + c_j \\approx \\log x_{ij}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn embeddings that satisfy this relation across all word pairs, we minimize a **weighted least-squares loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$J = \\sum_{i,j} f(x_{ij}) \\, (u_i^\\top v_j + b_i + c_j - \\log x_{ij})^2$\n",

    "##### Intuition\n",
    "- It models **semantic relationships** directly through **ratios of co-occurrence probabilities**, making it interpretable and mathematically grounded.\n",
    "- GloVe learns embeddings so that vector differences reflect **log co-occurrence ratios**, e.g.\n",

    "- **Why log ratios?** Logarithms linearize multiplicative relationships and stabilize large differences in probabilities.\n",
    "- **Why GloVe > SG-GCS:**  \n",

    "  - No costly global softmax normalization  \n",

    "#### The fastText Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Idea\n",
    "- In **word2vec**, each *word* has a single vector.\n",
    "- In **fastText**, each *word* is represented by the **sum of its subword vectors** (character n-grams).\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to capture **morphological information** (prefixes, suffixes, roots) and to represent **rare or unseen words** more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Subwords Are Built\n",
    "1. Add special boundary symbols `<` and `>` around the word to mark start and end.  \n",
    "   Example: `\"where\"` → `\"<where>\"`.\n",
    "2. Extract all character n-grams (substrings) of lengths between 3 and 6: “whe”, “her”, “ere”, “wher”, “here”, “<wh”, “re>”, “”, …\n",
    "3. Each of these subwords gets its own embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Word Representation\n",
    "If a word $w$ has subwords $g \\in G_w$, the word vector is: $v_w = \\sum_{g \\in G_w} z_g$, where $z_g$ is the embedding vector for subword $g$.\n",
    "So the meaning of a word = **sum of its subword embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- **Handles rare words** and **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words:  \n",
    "If a word wasn’t seen before, its subwords likely were.\n",
    "- **Shares parameters** between related words:  \n",
    "e.g., *running*, *runner*, *runs* share many subwords → better generalization.\n",
    "- **Drawback:** More parameters and computation — you must sum all subword vectors for every word."

    "#### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "FastText fixes subword length (e.g., 3–6 characters).  \n",
    "To allow *variable-length subwords* and a *controlled vocabulary size*, **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How BPE Works\n",
    "1. **Start** with all characters as basic symbols (e.g., `'a', 'b', ..., 'z', '_', [UNK]`).\n",
    "2. **Count frequencies** of all symbol pairs (like `'t'` + `'h'` → `'th'`).\n",
    "3. **Merge the most frequent pair** into a new symbol.\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until you reach a target vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a vocabulary of subwords that frequently appear together, efficiently capturing both characters and common morphemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example (simplified)\n",
    "Initial symbols: `[\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent pairs:\n",
    "- merge `(\"l\", \"o\")` → `\"lo\"`\n",
    "- merge `(\"lo\", \"w\")` → `\"low\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Final tokens may include `\"low\"`, `\"er\"`, `\"low_er\"` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why BPE Matters\n",
    "- Produces a **compact, data-driven subword vocabulary**.  \n",
    "- Handles both **rare words** and **morphologically rich languages**.\n",
    "- Used in **modern NLP models** (e.g., GPT-2, RoBERTa) to segment text into efficient subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insight\n",
    "Both **fastText** and **BPE** are subword-based solutions to the same problem:  \n",
    "> How to represent words that are rare, unseen, or morphologically complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fastText**: Summation of character n-gram vectors → captures morphology in embeddings.  \n",
    "- **BPE**: Learns optimal subword units via data compression → efficient tokenization for large-scale NLP models.\n",

    "#### From Context-Independent to Context-Sensitive\n",
    "Traditional models like word2vec and GloVe give each word a single vector, regardless of context (e.g., “bank” has the same vector in “river bank” and “bank loan”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Context-sensitive representations solve this by making each token’s vector depend on its surrounding words.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- TagLM – adds language-model embeddings to existing models.\n",
    "- CoVe – uses encoder states from machine translation models.\n",
    "- ELMo – uses deep bidirectional LSTMs; combines forward and backward context representations to produce embeddings that change with context. ELMo improves downstream tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, and question answering by adding context-aware information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Task-Specific to Task-Agnostic\n",
    "ELMo improved many NLP tasks but still required integrating its embeddings into each specific task model.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT introduced a task-agnostic pretraining architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "It pretrains a transformer on large text data using next-token prediction (unsupervised).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then fine-tunes it on specific downstream tasks with minimal architecture changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT uses a left-to-right (unidirectional) language model, so each token’s representation depends only on its left context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BERT: Combining the Best of Both Worlds\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) combines ELMo’s bidirectional context with GPT’s task-agnostic fine-tuning.\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "- BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer encoder to capture both left and right context simultaneously.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning for tasks is done by adding a small output layer — minimal task-specific modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to GPT, BERT differs by:\n",
    "- Using bidirectional context (vs GPT’s left-to-right).\n",
    "- Fine-tuning all Transformer parameters for each downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This made BERT achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, such as classification, QA, and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 1. The Training Input: Masking Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT takes plain text (no labels) and creates its own supervised learning problem by masking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example sentence:**  \n",
    "> “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT randomly picks **15% of tokens** for possible masking:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tokens | [The] | [quick] | [brown] | [fox] | [jumps] | [over] | [the] | [lazy] | [dog] |\n",
    "|---------|-------|---------|---------|-------|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| Mask?   | -     | ✔️      | -       | -     | ✔️      | -      | -     | ✔️     | -     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for those selected tokens (15%):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **80% of the time → replace with `[MASK]`**  \n",
    "  e.g. “The quick brown fox `[MASK]` over the `[MASK]` dog”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **10% of the time → replace with a random word**  \n",
    "  e.g. “The quick brown fox *eats* over the `[MASK]` dog”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **10% of the time → keep the same word**  \n",
    "  (This keeps the model from relying on the presence of `[MASK]` too literally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Model Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Each token (wordpiece) is converted to an **embedding vector**, plus **position** and **segment embeddings**.  \n",
    "These go through multiple **Transformer encoder layers** (attention + feedforward blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a **contextual embedding** for every token — meaning each position’s vector encodes context from the *entire sentence* (both left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. The “Supervision” Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though no human labels are provided, BERT **creates supervision automatically**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every masked word, BERT knows the original word (since it masked it itself).  \n",
    "That becomes the **label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input tokens:  [The] [quick] [brown] [fox] [MASK] [over] [the] [MASK] [dog]\n",
    "True tokens:   [The] [quick] [brown] [fox] [jumps] [over] [the] [lazy] [dog]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training labels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[MASK]_1` → “jumps”  \n",
    "- `[MASK]_2` → “lazy”\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicts a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each masked position:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(jumps | context) = 0.92\n",
    "P(run   | context) = 0.03\n",
    "P(eats  | context) = 0.01\n",
