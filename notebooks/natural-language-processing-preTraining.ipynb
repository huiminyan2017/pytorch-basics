    "\n",
    "Hierarchical softmax is an efficient alternative to the traditional softmax used in Word2Vec. Instead of computing probabilities over the entire vocabulary $|V|$,\n",
    "it organizes all words into a **binary tree**, where each **leaf node** corresponds to a word.\n",

    "Predicting a word becomes making a sequence of **binary decisions** along the path from the root to that word's leaf node.\n",

    "##### Why Subsampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language corpora, **high-frequency words** (e.g., “the”, “a”, “in”) appear extremely often.\n",
    "These words contribute little semantic information for learning word embeddings, yet they dominate\n",
    "training examples and slow down optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsampling addresses this by **randomly discarding frequent words** before training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Subsampling Achieves\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsampling:\n",
    "- Reduces the number of trivial and redundant training pairs\n",
    "- Speeds up training\n",
    "- Emphasizes informative word co-occurrences\n",
    "- Improves the quality of learned embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Rare words are kept almost always, while very frequent words are often removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Subsampling Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For each word token $w_i$ in the corpus, the probability of **keeping** it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{keep } w_i)\n",
    "= \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f(w_i)}},\n",
    "$$\n",

    "and the probability of **discarding** it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{discard } w_i)\n",
    "= \\max\\left(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f(w_i)}},\\, 0\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $f(w_i)$ is the relative frequency of word $w_i$ in the corpus\n",
    "- $t$ is a small threshold (typically $10^{-4}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $f(w_i) \\ll t$:  \n",
    "  the word is rare → almost always kept\n",
    "- If $f(w_i) \\gg t$:  \n",
    "  the word is very frequent → likely to be discarded\n",
    "\n",
    "This selectively removes words that carry little semantic signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effect on the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After subsampling:\n",
    "- Sentences become shorter\n",
    "- Context windows contain more informative words\n",

    "**Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negative sampling requires repeatedly drawing **noise words** according to a fixed distribution.\n",
    "- The distribution is specified via **sampling weights**, which may be unnormalized.\n",
    "- Efficient sampling is crucial because noise words are generated frequently during training.\n",

    "**RandomGenerator class**\n",
    "\n",
    "this class provides an efficient mechanism to perform this sampling during training:\n",
    "- accept a list of `sampling_weights` (e.g., proportional to $f(w)^{0.75}$), `sampling_weights` define how likely each word is to be sampled.\n",
    "- efficiently sample word indices according to these weights,\n",
    "- avoid repeatedly recomputing the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstraction allows negative sampling to be fast, reusable, and decoupled\n",

    "#### Skip-Gram with Global Corpus Statistics (SG-GCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview\n",
    "- Defines $ q_{ij} = P(w_j \\mid w_i) $, the conditional probability of context word $ w_j $ given center word $ w_i $.  \n",
    "- Computed via softmax: $ q_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(u_j \\cdot v_i)}{\\sum_k \\exp(u_k \\cdot v_i)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Idea\n",
    "- Uses **global co-occurrence statistics** rather than sliding local windows.  \n",
    "- Let $ x_{ij} $ be the number of times $ w_j $ appears in the context of $ w_i $.  \n",
    "- Objective:\n",
    "  $ J = - \\sum_i \\sum_j x_{ij} \\log q_{ij} $\n",
    "- Equivalent form:\n",
    "  $ J = - \\sum_i x_i \\sum_j p_{ij} \\log q_{ij}, \\quad p_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij}}{x_i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "- $ \\sum_j p_{ij} \\log q_{ij} $ is the **cross-entropy** between:\n",
    "  - empirical distribution $ p_{ij} $ (from corpus counts), and  \n",
    "  - model distribution $ q_{ij} $, weighted by $ x_i $.\n",
    "- Minimizing this loss aligns model predictions with corpus statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "  - Full softmax over the vocabulary is computationally expensive.\n",
    "  - Rare words can dominate the loss:\n",
    "    - The loss sums over **all observed (center, context) pairs**.\n",
    "    - Many rare words appear only once or twice.\n",
    "    - For rare pairs, $ \\hat{p}(c \\mid w) $ is very small, so $ -\\log \\hat{p}(c \\mid w) $ is large.\n",
    "    - Despite being rare, such events produce large gradients.\n",
    "    - In large corpora, many rare pairs accumulate → unstable or skewed embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The GloVe Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "The **GloVe (Global Vectors)** model addresses these issues by:\n",
    "- replacing cross-entropy with a **squared loss**, and  \n",
    "- directly modeling **log co-occurrence counts / ratios**, rather than probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Main Changes\n",
    "1. Replace probabilities with co-occurrence counts:\n",
    "   $ f_{ij} = x_{ij}, \\quad \\hat{f}_{ij} = \\exp(u_j \\cdot v_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a **squared error objective**:\n",
    "   $ J = (u_j \\cdot v_i + b_i + c_j - \\log x_{ij})^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add a **weighting function** to control frequent and rare pairs:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   h(x_{ij}) =\n",
    "   \\begin{cases}\n",
    "   (x_{ij}/a)^\\alpha, & x_{ij} < a \\\\\n",
    "   1, & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "   \\end{cases}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Typical values: $ a = 100 $, $ \\alpha = 0.75 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Final GloVe Loss Function\n",
    "$ J = \\sum_{i,j} h(x_{ij}) \\, (u_j \\cdot v_i + b_i + c_j - \\log x_{ij})^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Intuition\n",
    "- GloVe learns embeddings where **vector differences encode semantic relationships**.  \n",
    "- The weighting function stabilizes training by:\n",
    "  - down-weighting very rare pairs, and  \n",
    "  - preventing extremely frequent pairs from dominating.\n",
    "- The formulation is symmetric in $ (w_i, w_j) $, yielding comparable embeddings when roles are swapped.\n"

    "#### The fastText Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Idea\n",
    "- In **word2vec**, each *word* is assigned a single embedding vector.\n",
    "- In **fastText**, each *word* is represented as the **sum of its character n-gram (subword) embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design captures **morphological structure** (prefixes, suffixes, roots) and enables meaningful representations for **rare or unseen words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Subwords Are Built\n",
    "1. Add boundary symbols `<` and `>` to mark word start and end.  \n",
    "   Example: `\"where\"` → `\"<where>\"`.\n",
    "2. Extract all character n-grams of lengths typically between 3 and 6:\n",
    "   - Examples: `\"<wh\"`, `\"whe\"`, `\"her\"`, `\"ere\"`, `\"re>\"`, `\"wher\"`, `\"here\"`, `\"<whe\"`, …\n",
    "3. Each distinct n-gram is treated as a **subword unit** and assigned its own embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Subwords are **not linguistically predefined**.  \n",
    "> They are generated deterministically from raw character strings and learned purely from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Subwords Are Discovered / Learned\n",
    "- fastText does **not** discover subwords via clustering or segmentation.\n",
    "- Instead:\n",
    "  - All possible n-grams in the chosen length range are generated.\n",
    "  - Each n-gram is mapped (often via hashing) to an embedding index.\n",
    "  - During training, gradients flow to subword embeddings whenever their parent word appears.\n",
    "- Over time, useful subwords (e.g., “ing”, “tion”, “un”, “pre”) acquire meaningful vectors because they recur across many words.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Word Representation\n",
    "If a word $w$ has a set of subwords $G_w$, its embedding is: $ v_w = \\sum_{g \\in G_w} z_g $, where $z_g$ is the embedding of subword $g$.\n",
    "Thus, a word’s meaning is the **sum of its subword meanings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training Objective\n",
    "- fastText uses the **same objectives as word2vec**:\n",
    "  - Skip-gram with negative sampling (most common)\n",
    "  - CBOW\n",
    "- The only change is that the *input word vector* is replaced by the sum of its subword vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- **Robust to rare and OOV words**:  \n",
    "  Even unseen words can be embedded via known subwords.\n",
    "- **Parameter sharing across morphology**:  \n",
    "  Words like *run*, *running*, *runner*, *runs* share many subwords → better generalization.\n",
    "- **Captures spelling–meaning correlations**, useful for morphologically rich languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Trade-offs\n",
    "- **Higher memory usage**: many subword embeddings.\n",
    "- **More computation**: word vectors require summing multiple n-gram vectors at each update.\n",
    "- Uses hashing to control vocabulary size, which can introduce collisions (usually minor in practice)."

    "#### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "FastText fixes subword length (e.g., 3–6 characters).  \n",
    "To allow *variable-length subwords* and a *controlled vocabulary size*, **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How BPE Works\n",
    "1. **Start** with all characters as basic symbols (e.g., `'a', 'b', ..., 'z', '_', [UNK]`).\n",
    "2. **Count frequencies** of all symbol pairs (like `'t'` + `'h'` → `'th'`).\n",
    "3. **Merge the most frequent pair** into a new symbol.\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until you reach a target vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a vocabulary of subwords that frequently appear together, efficiently capturing both characters and common morphemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example (simplified)\n",
    "Initial symbols: `[\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent pairs:\n",
    "- merge `(\"l\", \"o\")` → `\"lo\"`\n",
    "- merge `(\"lo\", \"w\")` → `\"low\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Final tokens may include `\"low\"`, `\"er\"`, `\"low_er\"` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why BPE Matters\n",
    "- Produces a **compact, data-driven subword vocabulary**.  \n",
    "- Handles both **rare words** and **morphologically rich languages**.\n",
    "- Used in **modern NLP models** (e.g., GPT-2, RoBERTa) to segment text into efficient subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insight\n",
    "Both **fastText** and **BPE** are subword-based solutions to the same problem:  \n",
    "> How to represent words that are rare, unseen, or morphologically complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fastText**: Summation of character n-gram vectors → captures morphology in embeddings.  \n",
    "- **BPE**: Learns optimal subword units via data compression → efficient tokenization for large-scale NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuitive Comparison\n",

    "\n",
    "**Context-sensitive representations** address this by making each token’s embedding depend on surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- **TagLM** – augments existing models with language-model embeddings.\n",
    "- **CoVe** – uses encoder states from machine translation models.\n",
    "- **ELMo** – applies deep bidirectional LSTMs to combine left and right context, producing embeddings that vary by context; improves tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, and QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### From Task-Specific to Task-Agnostic\n",
    "Although ELMo boosts many NLP tasks, it must still be integrated into each task-specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT** introduced a task-agnostic pretraining approach:\n",
    "- Pretrains a Transformer on large text corpora via next-token prediction.\n",
    "- Fine-tunes the same model for downstream tasks with minimal changes.\n",
    "- Uses a left-to-right (unidirectional) language model, so each token depends only on left context.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### BERT: Combining the Best of Both Worlds\n",
    "**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** merges ELMo’s bidirectional context with GPT’s task-agnostic fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "- Uses a bidirectional Transformer encoder to capture both left and right context.\n",
    "- Adapts to downstream tasks by adding a small output layer, keeping architecture changes minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to GPT, BERT:\n",
    "- Models bidirectional context (vs. left-to-right only).\n",
    "- Fine-tunes all Transformer parameters for each task.\n",

    "This enables strong performance across many NLP tasks, including classification, question answering, and inference.\n",

    "- **ELMo** → contextual embeddings added to existing models.\n",
    "- **GPT** → task-agnostic, left-to-right Transformer with fine-tuning.\n",

    "#         [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])\n",

    "print(result)\n",
    "# tensor([1, 7, 8])\n",
    "```\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "- indices_rows and indices_cols are paired element-wise.\n",
    "- PyTorch selects: (0, 1) → 1, (1, 3) → 7, (2, 0) → 8\n",
    "- The output shape matches the shape of the index tensors.\n",
