    "\n",
    "Modern computers used in **deep learning** or **high-performance computing (HPC)** environments are composed of multiple key components that work together to execute, store, and transfer data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-balanced system design ensures that **no single component becomes a bottleneck** during computation, data movement, or communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Key Components of a Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical deep learning computer includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Processor (CPU)**  \n",
    "   - Executes programs and system operations.  \n",
    "   - Modern CPUs have 8 or more cores.  \n",
    "   - Manages program logic, control flow, and data orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory (RAM)**  \n",
    "   - Temporarily stores data during computation, such as model parameters and activations.  \n",
    "   - Provides fast access for CPUs and GPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Connection**  \n",
    "   - Provides external communication (e.g., Ethernet).  \n",
    "   - Bandwidth ranges from **1 GB/s to 100 GB/s**, depending on hardware.  \n",
    "   - In servers, advanced interconnects improve data flow between machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expansion Bus (PCIe)**  \n",
    "   - High-speed interface connecting CPUs to GPUs, SSDs, and network cards.  \n",
    "   - Provides **direct data transfer** between components.  \n",
    "   - Servers may include up to **8 GPUs** connected via PCIe; desktops usually have 1–2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Durable Storage**  \n",
    "   - Includes hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs).  \n",
    "   - Often connected via PCIe for fast data movement.  \n",
    "   - Stores large datasets and checkpoints efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Data Flow and Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical system, the **CPU acts as the central hub**:\n",
    "- It connects to **RAM, storage, GPUs, and the network** via the **PCIe bus**.\n",
    "- Data flows between these components as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "![PCI connection](./Images/PCIConnection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "- AMD’s **Threadripper 3** has **64 PCIe 4.0 lanes**, each supporting **16 Gbit/s bidirectional transfer**.\n",
    "- Total memory bandwidth can reach **up to 100 GB/s**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. System Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve high performance:\n",
    "- Data movement between CPU, GPU, and storage must be **well-balanced**.  \n",
    "- **CPU/GPU starvation** occurs if data isn’t fed quickly enough to processing units.  \n",
    "- The **network should not slow down synchronization** when using distributed training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Optimization Techniques:\n",
    "- **Interleave computation and communication** — ensures processors are always busy.  \n",
    "- **Avoid bottlenecks** — each component should operate near its optimal throughput.\n",

    "\n",
    "Modern CPUs typically use **DDR4 RAM**, providing **20–25 GB/s bandwidth per module**.  \n",
    "Each module has a **64-bit-wide bus**, and CPUs often support **2–4 memory channels**, giving a total bandwidth between **40 GB/s and 100 GB/s**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "##### 2. How Memory Access Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is accessed from RAM, the CPU must:\n",
    "1. **Send an address** to the memory module.\n",
    "2. Perform a **burst read**, where multiple consecutive data elements are read after the initial setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First access latency:** ~100 ns  \n",
    "- **Subsequent reads:** ~0.2 ns  \n",
    "  → The first read is about **500× slower** than subsequent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- **Random memory access** is costly.\n",
    "- **Sequential (burst) access** is much faster and should be preferred whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Memory Banks and Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is divided into **banks**, each capable of independent access.  \n",
    "This allows:\n",

    "For example, **ARM Cortex A77** can perform **up to 8 operations per cycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch prediction:**  \n",
    "When encountering a conditional branch, CPUs predict which path will be taken to avoid idle cycles.  \n",
    "If the prediction is wrong, the pipeline is flushed and restarted — losing cycles but improving average throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "To boost performance in compute-heavy tasks like deep learning, CPUs use **vectorization**, i.e., performing the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.\n",

    "**Example:** AMD EPYC CPUs can feature **256 MB of L3 cache** to boost multi-core data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Optimization Concepts\n",
    "- **Spatial locality:** Consecutive data stored together to exploit sequential access.  \n",
    "- **Temporal locality:** Recently used data kept in cache for reuse.  \n",
    "- **Prefetching:** Predicts and loads data likely to be used next.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cache Misses and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cache miss** occurs when data is not found in cache, forcing the CPU to fetch it from RAM (much slower).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Miss penalty:** CPU stalls while waiting for data.  \n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Access data sequentially, reuse data, and design algorithms for locality.\n",

    "If we use 4 GPUs, each processes ¼ of the training data per step, then synchronizes gradients with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- Scales efficiently to **many GPUs**.\n",
    "- Requires **minimal model changes**.\n",
    "- Works well for large datasets with many examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Synchronization cost grows with GPU count.\n",
    "- May lead to communication bottlenecks if network bandwidth is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Combining Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern deep learning:\n",
    "- **Hybrid strategies** (e.g., model + data parallelism) are used for massive models.  \n",
    "- Frameworks like **PyTorch Distributed**, **DeepSpeed**, and **Megatron-LM** support multi-level parallelism for large-scale training (billions of parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Model Copy | GPU Role | Best For | Main Limitation |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Model Parallelism** | Split across GPUs | Each GPU handles part of the model | Very large models | High communication overhead |\n",
    "| **Data Parallelism** | Full model per GPU | Each GPU handles different data | Large datasets | Gradient synchronization cost |\n",
    "| **Pipeline Parallelism** | Split sequentially | GPUs work in stages | Deep sequential models | Idle time (pipeline bubbles) |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary:\n",
    "- **Model parallelism** breaks up the **model**; **data parallelism** splits the **data**.  \n",
    "- Synchronization and communication efficiency determine scalability.  \n",
    "- Combining both enables training of models far beyond single-GPU limits — the foundation of **modern distributed deep learning**."
