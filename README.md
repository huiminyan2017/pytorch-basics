# PyTorch Basics

This repo contains various ML/LLM models implemented **from scratch (NumPy)** and with **PyTorch**.  
Goal: solidify my core concepts before moving to larger NLP/LLM projects.

## Models
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)
- Softmax Regression (multi-class classification, MNIST)
- Simple Neural Network (2 hidden layers)
- Transformer

## Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter exploration and demos.
- `data/` → runtime folder to store downloaded files and experiment results.

## How to start
The quickest way is to create a codespace on this repo, and follow LinuxSetup.txt to install all needed python packages.
Then it's goog to go to run these notebooks

Or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pytorch-basics.git
cd pytorch-basics
pip install -r requirements.txt  ?? To test
