# PyTorch Basics

This repo contains simple ML models implemented **from scratch (NumPy)** and with **PyTorch**.  
Goal: solidify core concepts before moving to larger NLP/LLM projects.

## Models
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)
- Softmax Regression (multi-class classification, MNIST)
- Simple Neural Network (2 hidden layers)

## Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter exploration and demos.
- `src/` → Reusable PyTorch code (datasets, models, training).
- `results/` → Plots and sample outputs.

## Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pytorch-basics.git
cd pytorch-basics
pip install -r requirements.txt
